Anime Girl Generator
=====

This is a rewrite and translation of Anime Girl Generator with some enhancement.

## Important note

It is NOT currently in development and wasn't since January 2012. I might still be available to talk about it though.

I since worked on a similar project in Qt (that is NOT compatible with AGG resources) called [Avator](http://www.yosko.net/static3/avator) which is a bit more advanced.

## Functionalities

It adds 2 functionality that weren't in the original :

1. Translated in English and French
2. Enhancement of the colorization functionality: you can now choose any hue for each layer

## Technical information

It was done in C# .Net (Framework .Net 3.5) with Visual Studio 2008. You can open the project through the `.cproj` file.

As I don't own the rights on the image files, they are not included here. Get them from the original website (directory `default`), and put it in `bin/Debug/` or `bin/Release/`.

There is even an InnoSetup script for generating the installer (the `.iss` file).

## Download

A compiled version is available on my website ([yosko.net](http://www.yosko.net/)), currently at [this address](http://www.yosko.net/static2/anime-girl-generator).

## License
